 # Overview
 The Personal Public File Folder for My GitHub is a dedicated space within my GitHub account where I can store and share files with the public. It serves as a convenient repository for various types of files, including documents, images, code snippets, presentations, and more.  This file folder allows me to showcase and share my work, projects, and resources with a wider audience. It enables others to easily access and download files that I have chosen to make public, thereby facilitating collaboration, learning, and knowledge exchange.
